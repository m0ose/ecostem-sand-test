Ecostem Sand
============
A version of ecostem for the Simtable sand table. Forked by m0ose

This project depends on `git@github.com:simtable/st-api.git` or a fork of it,
residing in a subdirectory named "st-api".


I made some hacky changes to the original ecostem-sand in an effort to make a robust way to find the fundamental matrix.
It uses Conner's Fundamental matrix work, mixed with a RANSAC algorithm. 

My test program is
